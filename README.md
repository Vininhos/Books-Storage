# What is BooksStorage?

BooksStorage is a Microservices Web/API application written in C#, Angular and Go, also using technologies like Docker and Kubernetes to deploy and MongoDB to store books. BooksStorage works as an application with a web view to search and consult added books on the database while using backend API's to feed and retrieve storaged books on the database.

# Why did you created this project?

In the start of the project, BooksStorage was supposed to be just a backend API for storaging Books in a MongoDB Collection, dedicated to use only for my DevOps studies, because a DevOps engineer needs a project to deploy, but instead of using someones project, I decided to create one project and use it. The project evolved to a little bit more than I was planning, but the best thing is that I'm now able to undestand a lot of development details that are attached to the DevOps culture and the deployment tools like Kubernetes. Another main goal of this project is to study tech that I wished to apply on something, so then I created this piece by piece while learning new things. I'm still building this project as a opportunity to grow my skills and make something.
